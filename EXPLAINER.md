# WebGPU Extended Range Brightness

## Introduction

This proposal introduces a mechanism through which WebGPU can draw colors
brighter than white (`#FFFFFF`).

## Background

WebGPU can currently create a canvas with a `GPUTextureFormat` of
"rgba16float". When this is done, values that are outside of the [0, 1]
interval are [clamped in luminance but not in chrominance](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/#canvas-color-space).

## Goal

The goal of this proposal is to provide a mechanism through which a WebGPU
canvas can indicate that its luminance should not be clamped.

## API proposal

Add the following new dictionaries.

```webidl
enum ExtendedRangeBehavior {
  "default",
  "clamp",
};

dictionary ExtendedRangeMetadata {
  required float headroom;
  ExtendedRangeBehavior behavior = "default";
};

dictionary CanvasColorMetadata {
  ExtendedRangeMetadata extendedRange;
};

partial dictionary GPUCanvasConfiguration {
  CanvasColorMetadata colorMetadata;
};
```

When a canvas is created with a `GPUCanvasConfiguration` that specifies a
`colorMetadata` which specifies an `extendedRange`, colors that have a linear
value less than `headroom` and are capable of being displayed by the display
device should not be clamped in luminance.

If the display device cannot display brightness up to the specified `headroom`,
then the display of the canvas depends on the `behavior` property.

If the `behavior` property is set to `"default"`, then the display will perform
a tone mapping operation on the entire canvas to map the brightness range
specified by `headroom` to the range of the display. This will affect the way
that all colors in the canvas are displayed (but will not affect the display of
any content outside of the canvas). The exact tone mapping operation not
specified and depends on the user agent, but an operation similar to the one in
ITU-R BT.2408 Annex 5, treating white as 203 nits is recommended.

If the `behavior` property is set to `"clamp"`, then all colors that are outside
of the capabilities of the display device will be clamped to the displayable
color range of the display device. All colors in the canvas that are within the
capabilities of the display device should not be altered.

## Non goals and future work

This proposal does not introduce Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) and Hybrid-Log Gamma
(HLG) transfer functions from ITU-R BT.2100 and ISO 22028-5 HLG. The natural
proposal to include this would update `PredefinedColorSpace` to include
`'rec2100-hlg'` and `'rec2100-pq'`.

This proposal does not introduce any of the metadata types discussed in ISO
22028-5. These metadata types include mastering display color volume (MDCV),
content colour volume (CCV) metadata, content light level (CLL), diffuse white
luminance metadata (NDWL), and reference viewing environment (REVE). The natural
proposal to include these would add new members to `CanvasColorMetadata`
corresponding to the various types of metadata.
